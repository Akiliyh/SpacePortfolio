In the year after I reworked this little concept bringing it to the mobile world using React Native and expo, extra features were added, like drops customization, changing music etc. Download the mobile app now to relax!

I focused on combining aesthetic design with functionality, ensuring smooth navigation and a responsive layout across devices. From project galleries to service descriptions, every element was crafted to reflect the client’s brand and professional identity. The end result is a modern, polished platform that effectively communicates the client’s expertise and creativity in the drone industry.",

Our goal was to highlight Corsica’s cultural heritage and amplify the voices of local residents, ensuring that tourism growth benefits the community as a whole. To achieve this, we designed a campaign centered around local tales and traditions, transforming them into engaging activities and thematic trails. Through this initiative, we aimed to make Corsica’s stories accessible to a wider audience while offering visitors authentic, meaningful experiences that go beyond the well-trodden tourist paths.",
