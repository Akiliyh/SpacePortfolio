It was built in one week during our first year Imac engineering course in collaboration with Océane Drapeau. Different bubbles entangle with each other to create new colors, environments and atmosphere. It is an experiment on how colors interact with each other in the space in movement. You can pan, move the camera around the bubbles and generate other palettes. Five templates are available to check out.",

I brought his vision to life using React and Supabase, creating a dynamic and interactive experience tailored to his needs. Multiple pages were designed to present his services and highlight his projects, providing a clear and engaging way for visitors to explore his work. I focused on combining aesthetic design with functionality, ensuring smooth navigation and a responsive layout across devices. From project galleries to service descriptions, every element was crafted to reflect the client’s brand and professional identity. The end result is a modern, polished platform that effectively communicates the client’s expertise and creativity in the drone industry.",

Like Japanese and Toki pona, it forms new words by combining existing words. For example, a sheet of paper can be said 'Crat cerit' 'Writing surface/ Surface for pen'. In this way, many words can be said in different ways and much is left to the interpretation of the speaker.",
